  "description" : "The transfer of mass between phases (gas<->aerosol or aerosol<->aerosol). This could be, for example, evaporation/condensation of a gas-phase species to an aerosol surface or transfer between layers in an onion-type model for condensed-phase viscosity. Multiple products are allowed for this type of process to allow, for example, acid dissociation processes to be combined with evaporation/condensation to an aqueous phase.",
