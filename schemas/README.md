Chemical Mechanism JSON Schema

The goals of the JSON schema for chemical mechanisms are:

- Provide sufficient information to calculate rates for each 'process' in the mechanism, whether by hand or in a model

- Require no more information than needed to describe the system

- Follow the JSON standard as closely as possible
